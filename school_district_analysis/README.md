# School Analysis with Pandas

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide insights into potential academic dishonesty among 9th graders at Thomas High School. The analysis of math and reading grades focuses on the grades of the other High School classes at Thomas High School and how aggregate grade performace among schools grouped by spending, size, and type are impacted by removing the suspect grades. This information aims to provide information to the school board as to the validity of the academic dishonesty suspicions.

## Results

To gain insights potential academic dishonesty among 9th graders at Thomas High School, [analysis](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/school_district_analysis/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb) was performed on [school](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/school_district_analysis/resources/schools_complete.csv) and [student](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/school_district_analysis/resources/students_complete.csv) information across the whole district. After running the analysis both with and without the suspect class from Thomas High Scool, the following comparative results are available.

* Impact on District Summary Results

* Impact on School Summary Results

* Impact on Thomas High School Performance Relative to Other Schools in the District

* Impact on Per Grade Analysis

  * Impact on Math and Reading Scores by Grade

  * Impact on Scores by School Spending

  * Impact on Scores by School Size

  * Impact on Scores by School Type
