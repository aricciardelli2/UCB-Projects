# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project to provide insights into the new field of Cryptocurrencies to Accountability Accounting so that they can include Cryptocurrencies as an investment portfolio option for customers. As Cryptocurrencies are new to the firm, the goal is simply to use the data to find similarities, or groups, so the firm can start to make sense of the new market. With this goal in mind, Unsupervised learning was chosed to cluster the Cryptocurreny [data](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/cryptocurrencies/resources/crypto_data.csv) using K-Means.

## Results

In order to find groups within the Crytocurrency market, K-Mean clustering was [performed](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/cryptocurrencies/crypto_clustering.ipynb) on the Cryptocurreny [data](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/cryptocurrencies/resources/crypto_data.csv). In order to complete this clustering and visualize the results to the firm, 4 steps were performed: Preprocessing the data, Reducing the data dimensionality, Cluster the data, and visualize the results.

### Preprocessing the Data

### Reducing the Data Dimensionality

### Cluster the Data

### Visualize the Results

## Summary

From the analysis above, the percentage of 5-Star reviews is 13.4% higher for the Vine reviews vs. Non-Vine reviews, there appears to be a bias towards positive reviews from the paid Vine program. The total number of reviews being much lower in the Vine program vs. the non-Vine program it could be argued that the 5-Star percentage gap is due to the sample size difference. However, as there are nearly 100 reviews in the Vine program and the percentage difference is fairly large at ~13%, we argue that this percentage difference is genuine.

Additional analysis that can be performed to gain more insights into what drives a positive 5-Star review is to perform a similar analysis based on if the review was for a Verified Purchase or not.
