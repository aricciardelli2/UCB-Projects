## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the [Bike Share Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/al.ricciardelli/viz/BikeRentalStory/BikeRentalStory) is to provide an interactable data story using Tableau for investors to be able to see data from a bike share company in New York City and understand why opening a Bike Share company in Des Moines Iowa is a great idea!

## Results

### Tableau Story

The [Bike Share Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/al.ricciardelli/viz/BikeRentalStory/BikeRentalStory) has a front page and 7 data visualizations to explain why opening a bike share company in Iowa is a great idea.

### Front Page
The [front page](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/bikesharing/resources/front_page.png) welcomes the user to the data story with explaining that this is a Tableau data story covering NYC Citi Bike Data. The front page is a dashboard showing three important high level pieces of data: Average Trip Duration, Rides by Gender, and Starting Locations. This data will inform the potential investors what the trip duration (in seconds) is depending on the age of the customer, help them understand who the customer is by gender, and where the supply of bikes should go in NYC.

### Checkout Time for Users
The [Checkout Time for Users](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/bikesharing/resources/checkout_times_for_users.png) shows potential investors the number of trips according to the total trip duration. The data shows that most trips are less than 1 hour with a mode of 5 minutes. This tells the investors that there is quick turnaround using the bikes, meaning that one bike can be used by a large number of customers in one day.

### Bike Utilization
The [Bike Utilization](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/bikesharing/resources/bike_utilization.png) shows potential investors the number of trips per unique bike ID. The data shows that while there are a few bikes that are used very oftern and will need more maintanance, most bikes aren't used as frequently and will need fewer costly repairs.

## Summary

The [Bike Share Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/al.ricciardelli/viz/BikeRentalStory/BikeRentalStory) provides many useful pieces of data to the potential investors on demand, customer base, maintanance, and turnover of the bikes. Two other data visualizations that would be useful would be seeing demand (total trips) according to weather as well as demand (total trips) aroudn holidays / non-holiday weekends.
