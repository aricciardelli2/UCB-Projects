# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide analysis of historical kickstar campaigns to provide insights for Louise's future kickstarter campaign to fund her play. The analysis of historical campaigns focuses on campaign success depending on time of year and campaign financial goal targets.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analysis was performed on quantity of successful, failed, and canceled theater related kickstarter campaigns as a function of the month at which the campaign started. Assessing the plot of campaign outcomes for theater campaigns based on launch date we see that there is a trend in outcome depending on the month of the launch date. ![](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/kickstarter-analysis/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

The number of successful campaigns is larger in the Summer months (May - August), with May having the hightest number of successful campaigns. Additionally, the number of successful campaigns is smaller at the end of the year (November - December), with December having the lowest number of successful campaigns. The number of failed and canceled campaigns stays relatively constant throughout the year.

Given the trend in successful campaigns depending on time of year, I recommend that a theater related Kickstarter campaign launch in May or June and avoid launching in November and December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analysis was performed on the success rate of play related kickstarter campaigns as a function of campaign financial goal targets. Assessing the plot of campaign outcomes for play campaigns based on goal amount we see that there is a trend in outcome depending on the target goal amount.

The percentage of successful campaigns is larger at lower goal totals and lower at larger goal totals. The percentage of failed campains follows the opposite trend with lower percentages at lower goal totals and higher percentages at higher goal totals. There were zero historical canceled play related campaigns.

Goal totals of less than $20,000 have a 50% chance or higher of being successful, with the percent chance growing the closer the goal total is to less than $1,000. Goal totals of $20,000 to $35,000 have a less than 50% chance of being successful, with the chance of success decreasing as the goal total increases from $20,000.

There are only a small number of data points for play campaigns with goal totals between $35,000 and $50,000 so the results in that range are noisy and an assessment is difficult to make for campaign success in that range. For campaigns with goals of $50,000 or more, the percent chance of success is very low at 12.5%.

Given the trend in successful campaigns depending on goal total, I recommend that a play related Kickstarter campaign have a target goal of less than $20,000 with an ideal target goal of less than $1,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
