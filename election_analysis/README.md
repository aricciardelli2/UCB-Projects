The analysis of the election is performed to determine the total votes from the election, candidate and county based election totals, and the winner of the election along with the county with the highest turnout. historical stock performance focuses on stock total daily trade volume and yearly return percentage. The election commission will use the information provided to report on the results of the election.

## Election-Audit Results

To analyze the results of the recent election, [python](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/election_analysis/PyPoll_Challenge.py) code was developed to read the [results](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/election_analysis/resources/election_results.csv) from the election and output the results of the [election analysis](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/election_analysis/analysis/election_analysis.txt).![](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/election_analysis/resources/election_results.png)

## Election-Audit Summary

To gain insights on which stocks Steve should advise his parents to invest in, [analysis](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/stock-analysis/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) was performed on results of historical stock performance in 2018. The total daily volume of trades as well as the anual return for 12 targeted stocks was calculated to determine high performing stocks for 2018. Assessing the table of stock performance from 2018 we see that many of the targeted stocks performed well.
