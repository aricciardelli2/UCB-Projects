# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to provide insights about stocks from previous years for Steve so he can help his parents make smart investments. The analysis of historical stock performance focuses on stock total daily trade volume and yearly return percentage. This information aims to provide information on which stocks will provide positive returns on investment for Steve's parents in the furture.

## Election-Audit Results

To gain insights on which stocks Steve should advise his parents to invest in, [analysis](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/stock-analysis/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) was performed on results of historical stock performance in 2017. The total daily volume of trades as well as the anual return for 12 targeted stocks was calculated to determine high performing stocks for 2017. Assessing the table of stock performance from 2017 we see that many of the targeted stocks performed well. ![](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/stock-analysis/resources/2017_stock_performance.png)

Every stock besides **TERP** had a positive return and point to a successful stock. The total daily volume is also important in gauging whether the stocks performance truley represented the stocks value with the higher the daily volume, the more representitive the return is of the stocks value. Stocks **FLSR** had a high return (101.3%) and high total daily volume (684,181,400) and would be the stock that I would recommend from the 2017 results. Steve's parents targeted stock **DQ**, had a high return but lower total daily volume. Due to the low total daily volume in 2017, I would not recommend investing in **DQ** without results from more trades.

## Election-Audit Summary

To gain insights on which stocks Steve should advise his parents to invest in, [analysis](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/stock-analysis/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) was performed on results of historical stock performance in 2018. The total daily volume of trades as well as the anual return for 12 targeted stocks was calculated to determine high performing stocks for 2018. Assessing the table of stock performance from 2018 we see that many of the targeted stocks performed well. ![](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/UCB-Projects/blob/main/stock-analysis/resources/2018_stock_performance.png)

Every stock besides **ENPH** and **RUN** had a negative return. Both **ENPH** and **RUN** had a high return (+80%) and high total daily volume (+500,000,000). Due to both of these factors, I would recommend both of these stocks from the 2018 results. Steve's parents targeted stock **DQ**, had a negative return and a moderate total daily volume. Due to the moderate daily volume pointing towards the negative return being representative of the stocks true value, I would not recommend investing in **DQ**.
